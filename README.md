# 3D Model Playground

Control 3D models using hand gestures and voice commands in real-time.

An interactive web app built with threejs, mediapipe computer vision, web speech API, and rosebud AI.

- Say "drag", "rotate", "scale", or "animate" to change the interaction mode
- Pinch fingers to control the 3D model
- Drag/drop a new 3D model onto the page to import it (GLB/GLTF format)
